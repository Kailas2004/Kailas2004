## Highlight Project

### Payment Settlement Engine

A production-inspired backend system that simulates financial settlement workflows with strong correctness guarantees.

**Key characteristics:**

- Idempotent settlement operations  
- Lock-safe state transitions  
- Audit logging for every attempt  
- Retry-safe failure handling  
- Role-governed operations  
- Failure simulation & recovery patterns

## Engineering Principles

- Correctness over cleverness  
- Explicit state over hidden behavior  
- Observability over assumption  
- Simplicity over premature optimization  

If a system cannot explain its own state, it is already fragile.
